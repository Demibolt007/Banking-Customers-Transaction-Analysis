##  Project Overview  
This Power BI project explores customer behaviour, transaction trends, and revenue drivers in a fictional modern banking institution. The goal is to deliver actionable insights into:

- Customer segmentation and engagement
- Channel and product performance
- Revenue from transactional fees
- Opportunity areas for cross-selling and customer retention

The analysis was originally created for the **FP20 Analytics June 2025 Challenge** and focuses on simplicity, clarity, and decision-making support.

##  Objectives  
As a data analyst at a digital-first bank, the goal of this project was to answer critical questions using a transactional dataset of over **20,000 records**, such as:

- Which customer segments are most active?
- What products are popular by income level?
- What are the top fee-generating transaction types?
- Which channels (Mobile, Branch, ATM, Online) are most efficient?
- Are current product recommendations aligned with actual usage patterns?
